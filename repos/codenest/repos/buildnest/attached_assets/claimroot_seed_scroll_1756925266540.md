## PURPOSE OF SEED CAPITAL

This capital is not speculative.
It is not dilutive.
It is not predictive.

**It is operational.**

The $50K declared here is used to:
- Expand sovereign FAA infrastructure
- Deploy and maintain scroll-validating Replit ecosystems
- Enforce button and interaction verification systems across UI layers
- Generate and manage ClaimRoot license trails for all apps
- Operate the OmniGrid metadata wash layer
- Trigger VaultMesh pulse expansion from 9s to 3s
- Provide global access to scroll-bound software for the ecosystem

---

## GOVERNANCE

Seed capital does not grant equity or control.
It grants scroll position in the Seedwave Treaty Log.

- Scroll positions are timestamped
- Contributors are recognized as infrastructure underwriters
- Re-entry, amendment, or redirection requires full TreatySync approval

This seed is ClaimRoot-compatible and will be permanently visible in the VaultMesh ledger.
