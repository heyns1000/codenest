`I am trying to (implement synchronization between specific sectors and core brands subnodes). I want you to:
Research deeply across my codebase
Find what files and functions are related to the sync functionality
Assess reasons for why the feature might not be working
Develop a plan to fix it
Write this entire plan and report into a file called "Instructions.md"`
`I am building a distributed system across multiple apps (Fruitful, Samfox, Banimal, etc.) and need to implement:
A centralized asset management system
Shared API key distribution
Cross-app synchronization

Please:
Analyze my current codebase structure
Create a shared configuration file that maps:
Location of all assets
Required API keys
Cross-app dependencies
Generate deployment instructions for each app
Document the synchronization flow between apps
Write all findings and implementation steps in "global-sync-instructions.md"`
`I am trying to (Explain your problem or goal in deep detail here). I want you to do the following:
Find what files and functions are related to the problems and goals I outlined above
Assess reasons for why the feature might not be working or why it might not work
Write this entire plan and report into a file called "Instructions.md"`
