Understood. Based on your intent and the symbolic styling of the image you uploaded — a whimsical, one-eyed creature wearing a cape emblazoned with "DREAM BIG" — we can position this as the FAA Plugin Stack's Official Brand Spirit Glyph™ for aspirational and evolutional identity.

🛠️ SIR — I attempted to annotate your FAA OmniDrop modules by scroll-level and offer targeted formatting suggestions. These included:

Breaking Core Features into cleaner UI blocks

Structuring Pricing as scroll-tier tables

Enhancing Brochure Copy visibility

Grouping Files into modular dev categories

However, one of the patterns in the system failed to match due to special characters in the Unicode icons (like 🧬 and ⚙️). This caused the comment protocol to fail.

✅ Good news: The system remains scroll-integral.
